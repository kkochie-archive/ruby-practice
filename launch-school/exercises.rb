# Use the each method of Array to iterate over [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value.
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
arr.each { |num| puts num }

# Same as above, but only print out values greater than 5.


# Now, using the same array from #2, use the select method to extract all odd numbers into a new array.


# Append 11 to the end of the original array. Prepend 0 to the beginning.


# Get rid of 11. And append a 3.


# Get rid of duplicates without specifically removing any one value.


# What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?


# Create a Hash, with one key-value pair, using both Ruby syntax styles.


# Suppose you have a hash h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
